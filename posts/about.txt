Welcome to PPPage!

This is a simplified blog system that reads posts from .txt files and displays them with hover notes and embedded images.

## What This Is

PPPage is a minimalist blog platform designed for simplicity and ease of use. Instead of complex content management systems, posts are written in plain text files and uploaded directly to GitHub.

## Features

- **Plain Text Posts**: Write in simple .txt format
- **Hover Notes**: Add interactive notes using [display text:note content] syntax
- **Image Support**: Embed images with [IMAGE], [IMAGEL], or [IMAGER] syntax
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatically finds posts from your GitHub repository
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## How It Works

1. Write your posts in .txt files
2. Upload them to the `posts/` directory on GitHub
3. Add images to corresponding folders
4. The site automatically discovers and displays your content

## Technical Details

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks, no databases - just simple, reliable web technology.
