Started with the assumption it would only take a day or two, ended up taking a week and a half.</p>\n\n<p>I'd never 'vibe coded' before and curious to see how valid the looming threat of AI is, decided to give it a shot. I started in chatGPT then moved to Copilot, then Cursor.</p>\n\n<p>I knew the aesthetic I wanted in a website, mainly an interface for myself that appeared the pretentious artist/techie, and one that I could consequently post to socials on without ever opening a social media platform. Steele by a dream of shitposting from a pen and paper I embarked.</p>\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<img src=\"assets/square1.svg\" alt=\"Square with bird drawing\" style=\"width: 100px; height: auto; border: 1px solid var(--fg);\" />\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">You're absolutely right!</span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Very quickly I was able to assemble a preview html and iterate on the aesthetic. The only programming language I know is lua and I don't have any experience in web development, yet I was interested to see if AI was the magic bullet that would allow laypersons to do any task.</p>\n\n<p>After the html preview I used that to start requesting features be added and the real fun began.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin: 20px 0;\">\n<img src=\"assets/square2.svg\" alt=\"Square with handwritten text\" style=\"width: 150px; height: auto; border: 1px solid var(--fg);\" />\n</div>"
