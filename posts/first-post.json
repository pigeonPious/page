Started with the assumption it would only take a day or two, ended up taking a week and a half.</p>\n\n<p>I'd never 'vibe coded' before and curious to see how valid the looming threat of ai is, decided to give it a shot. I started in chat GPT then moved to Copilot, then Cursor.</p>\n\n<p>I knew the aesthetic I wanted in a website, mainly an interface for myself that appeased the pretentious artist tic, and one that I could conceivably post to socials on without ever opening a social media platform.
