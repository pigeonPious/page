# Video Demo Post

This post demonstrates the new video support in the [IMAGE] syntax!

## How it works

The [IMAGE] syntax now supports both images and videos. Simply place your video files (like .mov, .mp4, .avi, or .webm) in the same folder as your post, and use [IMAGE] to display them.

## Example

[IMAGE]

This will automatically load and display the first video file found in the post folder.

## Supported formats

- **Images**: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg
- **Videos**: mp4, mov, avi, webm

## Features

- **Video thumbnails** - Videos display as 120x120px square thumbnails in posts
- **No inline playback** - Videos cannot be played in the small preview
- **Video preview frames** - Shows first frame as preview before clicking
- **Play button overlay** - Clear visual indication that videos are clickable
- **Click to expand** - Click any video to view it in full-screen overlay with controls
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Automatic format detection

## Multiple videos

[IMAGE]

You can use multiple [IMAGE] tags to display multiple videos or mix videos and images in the same post.

## Notes

- Videos are preloaded with metadata for better performance
- The system automatically detects file types and renders them appropriately
- All existing image functionality remains unchanged
