This is a sample post to demonstrate the new .txt file format.

## Hover Notes

You can create hover notes using this syntax: [hover over this text:This is the content that appears when you hover over the text!]

Another example: [click here:This will show additional information when you hover over "click here"]

## Images

You can add images using the [IMAGE] syntax. The system will automatically load images from a folder with the same name as this post.

[IMAGE]

Here's some text between images.

[IMAGE]

And another image at the end.

## Formatting

The system automatically parses:
- Titles (lines starting with # or first non-empty line)
- Dates (lines starting with Date:)
- Keywords (lines starting with Keywords:)
- Content (everything after metadata or after 10 lines)

This makes it easy to write posts in plain text while maintaining structure.
