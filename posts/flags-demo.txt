# Demo Post with FLAGS Syntax [FLAGS: demo, programming, tutorial]

Date: 2024-12-19

This is a demonstration post showing how to use the new [FLAGS: category1, category2] syntax for automatic categorization.

## How it works:

1. **In the title**: You can add `[FLAGS: category1, category2]` directly in the title
2. **In the content**: You can also add `[FLAGS: category1, category2]` anywhere in the post content
3. **Multiple locations**: You can use both title and content flags - they'll be combined
4. **Automatic removal**: The `[FLAGS: ...]` syntax is automatically removed from the displayed post

## Example categories you can use:

- `programming` - for coding-related posts
- `design` - for design and UI posts  
- `tutorial` - for how-to guides
- `devlog` - for development logs
- `website` - for website-related content
- `personal` - for personal updates
- `tech` - for general tech posts

## Benefits:

- **Automatic categorization**: Posts automatically appear in the correct sitemap categories
- **No manual setup**: Just write `[FLAGS: category1, category2]` and you're done
- **Flexible placement**: Can be in title, content, or both
- **Clean display**: The syntax is removed from the final post display

This post will automatically appear in the "demo", "programming", and "tutorial" categories in the sitemap!
