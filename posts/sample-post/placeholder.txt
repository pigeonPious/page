This folder would contain image files for the sample-post.

To add actual images:
1. Upload .jpg, .png, .gif, .webp, or .svg files to this folder
2. The system will automatically detect and load them
3. Use [IMAGE] in your .txt file to place them

The system will:
- Load the first [IMAGE] with the first image found
- Load the second [IMAGE] with the second image found
- If there are more [IMAGE] calls than images, it will randomly select from available images
