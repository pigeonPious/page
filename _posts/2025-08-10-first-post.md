<p>This is the first example. The image is floated right to match the preview.</p>

<img class="float-right" src="https://picsum.photos/seed/magazine/520/340" alt="Right aligned image that text wraps beside">

<p>Text wraps to the left. Add a <span class="note-link" data-note="This is a hover note on a word.">hover note</span> anywhere.</p>

<div class="clear-after"></div>

<p>Below the image, content spans the full width of the column again.</p>
