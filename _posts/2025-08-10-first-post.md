Welcome to the new blog. The layout is intentionally sparse to mimic a text editor window.

- Taskbar-like menus along the top (File, Edit, Navigation, View, Log)
- Narrow column of text with generous spacing
- Dark and light modes available under **View**

Images in posts render smaller than the body width and float to the right, like the screenshot above.
