<p>Here the image is floated right so the first part of the content wraps alongside it.</p>
<p><img class="float-right" src="{{ '/assets/img/sample-right.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Right aligned image that text wraps beside"></p>
<p>This text continues alongside the image until the image’s height is exceeded. Lines stop at the left edge of the image for a clean margin.</p>
<div class="clear-after"></div>
<p>Now we’re below the image. The content resumes across the full width again, ensuring no text ever appears “behind” the media.</p>
<p>Here’s a <span class="note-link" data-note="Hover notes follow your cursor.">hover note</span> for reference.</p>
