<p>Here the image is floated right so the first part of the paragraph can wrap beside it. The wrap ends exactly at the image’s bottom edge; after that we force a clear so the next block starts below the image.</p>
<img class="float-right" src="{ '/assets/images/sample-1.jpg' | relative_url }" alt="Right image">
<p>This text continues alongside the image until the image height is reached. You’ll notice that lines stop at the left edge of the image for a clean margin.</p>
<div class="clear-after"></div>
<p>Now we’re below the image. The content resumes across the full column width again.</p>
<p>This sentence has a <span class="note-link" data-note="Hover me — small window follows the cursor.">hover note</span>.</p>
