# PPPage Post Syntax Reference

Title line
- Use a heading line for the title:
  # Your Title Here
- Or metadata:
  Title: Your Title Here
  Date: YYYY-MM-DD
  Keywords: tag1, tag2

Flags
- Inline anywhere to categorize posts; removed from render, merged into keywords:
  [FLAGS: Category1, Category2]

Hover notes
- Create inline hover notes:
  [DISPLAY TEXT:This text shows on hover]
- If the note contains a URL, it becomes clickable.

Images (co-located media)
- Place images/videos in the same folder as the .txt (preferred). Supported: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg, mp4, mov, avi, webm.
- Insert placeholders in content; they will be filled in order by discovered media files.
  [IMAGE]   # right-aligned
  [IMAGER]  # right-aligned (explicit)
  [IMAGEL]  # left-aligned

Notes
- New posts can live in nested subfolders under posts/, e.g. posts/devlogs/newpost/newpost.txt
- Slug is derived from the relative path (devlogs/newpost). If the file name matches the parent folder name, the slug omits the duplicated last segment.
- Media is loaded from posts/<slug>/ using raw GitHub URLs; the static index pre-computes mediaPaths to avoid API rate limits.
