# Simple duck illustration representation
# This is a text-based representation that should be converted to an actual PNG image
# 
# The duck should be:
# - Drawn in profile, facing right
# - Simple line drawing style
# - Enclosed in a black rectangular border
# - Approximately 200x200 pixels
# - PNG format with transparent background
# 
# Since I cannot generate actual image files, you'll need to:
# 1. Take a screenshot of the duck area from your handwritten page
# 2. Crop it to focus on the duck illustration
# 3. Save it as duck-illustration.png in the assets folder
