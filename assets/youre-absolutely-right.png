# "You're absolutely right!" text box representation
# This is a text-based representation that should be converted to an actual PNG image
# 
# The text box should contain:
# "You're
# absolutely
# right!
# _-_"
# 
# - Enclosed in a black rectangular border
# - Approximately 200x200 pixels
# - PNG format with transparent background
# 
# Since I cannot generate actual image files, you'll need to:
# 1. Take a screenshot of the text box area from your handwritten page
# 2. Crop it to focus on the "You're absolutely right!" text box
# 3. Save it as youre-absolutely-right.png in the assets folder
