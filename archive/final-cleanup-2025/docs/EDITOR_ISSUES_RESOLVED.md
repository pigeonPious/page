# Editor Issues Resolved - Complete

## ✅ **Editor Loading Issue Fixed**

The white page and favicon errors have been resolved. The editor is now fully functional.

### **🔧 Issues Identified & Fixed:**

#### **1. White Page Issue:**
- **Problem**: Editor.html was showing a blank white page when accessed via File > New

#### **2. Script Loading:**

  ```html
  <script src="shared-taskbar.js"></script>
