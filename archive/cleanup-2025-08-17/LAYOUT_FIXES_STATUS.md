# LAYOUT FIXES APPLIED - STATUS UPDATE

## ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### 1. ✅ **Taskbar Spacing Issue**
**Problem**: Menu items were spread across the full width instead of being grouped together
**Cause**: `justify-content: space-between` in `.menu-bar-inner` was spreading items
**Fix**: Removed `justify-content: space-between` from `.menu-bar-inner`

### 2. ✅ **Editor-Only Elements Visible**
**Problem**: Editor-only elements (like GitHub status) were visible on main page, affecting layout
**Cause**: `.editor-only` class was not defined in `style.css`
**Fix**: Added `.editor-only { display: none !important; }` to hide editor elements on main page

### 3. ✅ **Main Content Positioning**
**Problem**: Main content area was not properly positioned within the grid layout
**Cause**: `.center-content` class was undefined
**Fix**: Added proper grid positioning and padding for `.center-content`

## CURRENT STATE

## VERIFICATION NEEDED
- [ ] Compare main page layout with editor layout

## FILES MODIFIED
- `/Users/julianelwood/Developer/ppPage/page/style.css`
