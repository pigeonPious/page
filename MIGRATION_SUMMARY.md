# Migration Summary: FaunaDB → Netlify Blob Store

## ✅ **Changes Completed**

### **Removed FaunaDB Dependencies**
- ❌ Removed `faunadb` package from `package.json`
- ❌ Removed FaunaDB setup instructions from `NETLIFY_SETUP.md`
- ❌ Removed `FAUNADB_SECRET` environment variable requirement

### **Added Netlify Blob Store**
- ✅ Added `@netlify/blobs` package to `package.json`
- ✅ Updated all draft-related functions to use Netlify Blob Store
- ✅ Simplified environment variable setup (only GitHub token needed)

### **Updated Functions**
- **`save-draft.js`**: Now uses Netlify Blob Store instead of FaunaDB
- **`get-drafts.js`**: Retrieves drafts from Blob Store with user filtering
- **`delete-draft.js`**: Deletes drafts from Blob Store with proper authorization

### **Documentation Updates**
- **`NETLIFY_SETUP.md`**: Removed all FaunaDB setup steps
- **`functions/README.md`**: Updated to reflect new storage architecture

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Change**

1. **Simpler Setup**: No external database registration required
2. **Cost-Effective**: No additional database costs
3. **Better Integration**: Uses Netlify's native storage
4. **Same Functionality**: All draft features still work perfectly
5. **More Reliable**: One less external dependency

## 🚀 **Updated Setup Process**

### **Environment Variables (Only 3 needed now!)**
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token (Secret)
GITHUB_REPO=username/repo
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
```

### **Setup Steps**
1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Set environment variables (no database setup!)
3. Enable Netlify Identity
4. Start blogging!

## 📊 **Data Storage Architecture**

```
📁 Published Posts → GitHub Repository (version controlled)
📁 Draft Posts → Netlify Blob Store (user-isolated)
📁 Categories → GitHub Repository (in data/categories.json)
🔐 Authentication → Netlify Identity
```

## 🛡️ **Security & Privacy**

- **Drafts**: Stored per-user in Netlify Blob Store (private)
- **Published Posts**: Stored in GitHub repository (public/private as you choose)
- **Authentication**: Netlify Identity (invite-only)
- **API Access**: Protected by authentication

## ✨ **No Action Required**

The migration is complete! Your blog will now use Netlify Blob Store for drafts automatically. No external database setup needed.
